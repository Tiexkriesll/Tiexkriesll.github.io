                      <p>Fishing is a casual open world activity. In order to catch fish, <strong>Bait</strong> and <strong>Fishing Rod</strong> are necessary. Both can be purchased with Gold from a [Fishing Supplies] merchant, and higher grade Fishing Rods and Baits can be exchanged with <strong>Angler Tokens</strong> from an [Angler Token Vendor].</p>
                      <p><strong>[Fishing Supplies]</strong> merchant and <strong>[Angler Token Vendor]</strong> are located at fisheries and major cities.<br>
                         Fish caught can be delivered to select NPCs for Gold or goods, or can be dismantled to obtain <strong>Fish Filet</strong> (Arborean Fish) or Kirash Filet (Exodor Fish) which can be used as Cooking materials.</p>
                      <p>Fish caught cannot be traded and <strong>fishing does not impact PvE or PvP.</strong></p>

<br><h3>Basics</h3>     
                      <p>With Bait and Fishing Rod in hand, players can head over to a fishery to start fishing. Before casting a fishing line with the Fishing Rod, Bait must be toggled on. <br>
                         This can be done through Inventory, players can right-click toggle to activate a bait - appropriate effect icon indicates that the bait is active. <strong>Once toggled on</strong>, players can right-click the Fishing Rod to cast a line. Fishing Rod can be right-click held to cast the line farther away.</p>
                      <p>&#9679; Both Bait and Fishing Rod can be registered to a skill slot.</p>
                      <p>When a fish bites, players can press the interact key <strong>(default : F)</strong> to manually catch the fish, or wait a few minutes for the system to automatically catch the fish for you. Manual fishing is a lot quicker but requires more effort as difficulty increases with the grade of the fish.</p>

<br><h3>Manual fishing</h3>     
                 <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-md-6">
                    <div class="left-content">                      
                      <p>In order to catch fish manually, players must play a <strong>mini-game</strong>. The key objective of the mini-game is to move the square on the left towards the reel on the right by reeling the fish appropriately within a time limit. <br>
                         Fish can be pulled to the right by holding the interact key (default : F) and Fish must overlap with the square in order to move it.</p>
                      <p>Difficulty of the mini-game increases relative to the grade of the fish to be caught - the square to shift to the right decreases in width, and the fish to be caught can resist more strongly and more often.<br>
                         Difficulty can be decreased using <strong>Fish Salad</strong>.<br>
                         After manual fishing, the system does not recast the fishing line for the player.</p>
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-md-6">

                 </div> 
                                  
<br><h3>Automatic fishing</h3>      
                 <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-md-6">
                    <div class="left-content">                      
                      <p>Instead of pressing the interact key (default : F) to manually fish, fishing can be automated when left idle for 3 minutes of auto-fishing time. After waiting and the fish is automatically caught, and the system recasts a fishing line. <br>
                         Players can switch to manual fishing at any point during the auto-fishing time.<br>
                         Automatic fishing will continue until players runs out of bait or inventory is full.</p>
                      <p>Auto-fishing time can be reduced by using <strong>Fairywing Rod</strong>, or equipping <strong>Angler뭩 Whiskers</strong> and <strong>Card effects</strong> from Card Collection.<br>
                         Generally auto-fishing cannot catch BAF natively, and requires a Companion with <strong>BAF Auto-Fishing ability</strong> to be summoned.</p>

<br><h3>Big-Ass Fish</h3>
                 <p>Rare fish called <strong>BAF</strong>, short for Big-Ass Fish have a rare chance to bite. BAF can be delivered to a Fish Associated Fishmonger NPC for at least 500 Gold.<br>
                   <strong> There are several things that can increase the chance to catch a BAF :</strong></p>
                 <ul>
                   <li><p>Premium bait such as Popori Bait or Rainbow Bait (item)</p>

                 <p>Other than the Old Fishing Rod, there are 3 different types of Fishing Rods : <strong>Xermetal</strong>, <strong>Ash Sapling</strong>, <strong>Fairywing Rod</strong>. <br>These Fishing Rods have special effects that affect fishing and can be upgraded up to tier VIII.</p>
