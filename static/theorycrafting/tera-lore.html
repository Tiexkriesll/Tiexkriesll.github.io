               <p>In the beginning of time, above the vast open universe, lived Arun and Shara.<br>
                  There was an endless battle between light and darkness.The fight just went on and on for no apparent reason.Two beings, tired of this battle, wished to break away from their camps and escape to another dimension.<br>
                  They decided to leave the chaotic world that they knew, and created a space which they can call their own and barriers were put in place to shield off this newly created space from the chaos outside that both Arun and Shara called home.</p>

               <p>Arun and Shara named this peaceful space: Arborea.</p>
               <p>Pathways were also built along the barriers surrounding Arborea, these pathways were guarded by Mystel, hence they are also known as: “Mystel’s Path”.<br>
                  Two continents were formed during the creation of Arborea, and took on the names of their creator: Arun and Shara.<br>
                  A sun was created to provide a thriving environment for all kinds of life-forms to flourish. The breath from Arun and Shara became the life-force of all living creatures.</p>
               <p>From the heart of each titan came a spring that became the Fountain of Shara and Fountain of Arun. These fountains are the rawest source of primal power in their new world.</p>

               <h4><strong>03- Birth of the first “god”, Manahan</strong></h4>
               <p>Manahan is the eldest son and only son of Arun and Shara. As he grew up alone, he began to wonder about the outside of this world.</p>
               <p>Arun and Shara asked him not to go to the end of the world like that, but in the end he ignored them and secretly went to the end of the world.<br>
                  And there was a huge door.<br>
                  Manahan puts his hand on the door and seen a crack, and then a black space visible beyond the door. <br>
                  Beyond that, there was something that Manahan had never seen before, and in that moment Manahan tried to reach out to it.</p>
               <p>Arun and Shara found out the location of Manahan and came in haste.<br>
                  Arun and Shara pierced the rift in the world that Manahan opened, and then punished Manahan that he has to be confined in the rift space that leads to another dimension beyond the end of our world that Manahan wanted so much to go to.</p>
               <p>Manahan cursed Arun and Shara as he gets trapped in the rift.<br>
                  Having locked up their first child, Manahan, Arun and Shara fell into a long sleep but before they go to sleep, they make other gods instead of Manahan.</p>

               <h4><strong>04- Birth of the next 31 gods</strong></h4>
               <p>Manahan is very powerful and has an unquenchable sense of curiosity, and perhaps might one day threaten the safety of Arborea. <br>
                  Therefore Arun and Shara used parts of Arborea to create the next 11 gods:<br>
                  &#9679; Karas<br>
                  &#9679; Sikander<br>
                  &#9679; Zuras<br>
                  &#9679; Gidd<br>
                  &#9679; Saleron<br>
                  &#9679; Isren<br>
                  &#9679; Glumo<br>
                  &#9679; Tithus<br>
                  &#9679; Amarun<br>
                  &#9679; Dagon<br>
                  &#9679; Elinu<br><br>
                  Later, Arun and Shara used parts of the gods above, including Manahan himself, and created another 20 gods:<br>
                  &#9679; Balder<br>
                  &#9679; Oryin<br>
                  &#9679; Lok<br>
                  &#9679; Zenobia<br>
                  &#9679; Yurian<br>
                  &#9679; Kaia<br>
                  &#9679; Shakan<br>
                  &#9679; Velik<br>
                  &#9679; Ishara<br>
                  &#9679; Yaeryn<br>
                  &#9679; Thulsa<br>
                  &#9679; Bahaar<br>
                  &#9679; Seren<br>
                  &#9679; Killian<br>
                  &#9679; Lakan<br>
                  &#9679; Arachne<br>
                  &#9679; Akasha<br>
                  &#9679; Herate<br>
                  &#9679; Dakos<br>
                  &#9679; Icaruna<br><br>
                  These 31 gods called themselves the children of the ancient gods: Arun, and Shara.<br>
                  One day after a very long time,an existence whose origin is unknown appears in Tera's world. She later became the guardian deity of the human city of Velika.She was called the goddess Velik.<br>
                  When everyone fell asleep, even the other children, gods created by Arun and Shara, start shaping the world to their imagination.</p>  
                 <center><strong><i>...many years pass...</i></strong></center>
                 <p>The other gods, the children of Arun and Shara, were doing well, but they were fighting for supremacy.The god of the sun Balder dies to his younger brother as Lok gets sealed away for what he has done.</p>

               <h4><strong>05- First creation of Manahan</strong></h4>
               <p>Having watched his parents at work, the curious Manahan tried to create something himself. As a result, Shandra Manaya was born.</p>
               <p>However at his young age, Manahan was still unskilled in the art of creation, and could only mimic what his parents did, therefore Shandra Manaya turned out as an incomplete being. <br>
                  She existed neither as a god nor the beginning of a thriving race.</p> 
               <br>
               <h4><strong>06- Manahan’s curiosity; Arborea shattered</strong></h4>
               <p>There was this one argon who got interested in sun. He flew towards it and messed with it so it became unstable. Manahan caught the lost argon and fixed the damaged sun (but imperfectly - thus created day&night).</p>
               <p>As a growing youth, Manahan always wondered what existed outside the barrier surrounding Arborea. Driven by his ever growing curiosity, he broke through a part of the barrier which surrounded and protected Arborea.<br>
                  Due to his actions, Arborea itself shattered into several pieces. In this exact instance, another strange and unfamiliar space was simultaneously formed, later known simply as: “Yakaia”.</p>          
               <br>
               <h4><strong>07- Manahan in exile</strong></h4>
               <p>Manahan’s reckless action brought upon an unimaginable danger to Arborea.<br>
                  Realising Manahan can no longer be allowed to do things at his whim, Arun and Shara banished and imprisoned him into Yakaia. Manahan’s powers were then used to stabilise fractured Arborea.</p>
               <p>While the other Gods knew of his creation and existence, he became someone no longer spoken of. His existence would never become known to the mortal races, and so he became merely an "ancient name best forgotten."</p>
               <br>
               <h4><strong>08- Repairing of the barrier</strong></h4>
               <p>Arun and Shara repaired the damage done by Manahan to the barrier protecting Arborea, and eradicated the chaotic energies that had seeped through.</p>
               <p>Arun and Shara were aware of the fact that the powers possessed by the other 31 gods, could bring about peace and prosperity to Arborea, but could also bring about catastrophic calamity to it.</p>
               <p>Arun and Shara also agreed that no god can be the supreme ruler of Arborea, as this will one day threaten the its stability.<br>
                  A stone tablet, “Arucana Kenaia” was created, containing the memories of Arun and Shara.</p>

               <p>Six of the wisest gods deciphered the knowledge in the “Arucana Kenaia”, and <strong>created the six main races</strong>.</p>
               <p>&#9679; <strong>Karas</strong> deciphered the tablet first and created the Elves(I know they are known as the “High Elves”, there will be an explanation for this later).<br>
                  &#9679; <strong>Zuras</strong> created the Devas(later known as the Castanics, also will be an explanation of this later).<br>
                  &#9679; <strong>Amarun</strong> created the Amans.<br>
                  &#9679; <strong>Tithus</strong> created the Giants(the main race which the Barakas belong to).<br>
                  &#9679; <strong>Gidd</strong> created the Humans.<br> 
                  &#9679; <strong>Elinu</strong> created the Poporis and Elins. She created them in her own image by severing a piece of her soul and essence.</p>
               <p>Arun and Shara were both very satisfied with the newly created races.</p>

                 Therefore, they handed “Gidd’s Spear”(a weapon capable of killing and absorbing the powers of a god) to Gidd, who was known to be both wise and justiful.</p>
               <p>Understanding the will of Arun and Shara, Gidd vowed to protect Arborea.</p>
               <p>After Arun and Shara created a mysterious temple, they decided it is time for a rest, and both fell into a deep slumber.</p>

               <p>The six wisest gods led their creations and settled in different parts of Arborea.</p>
               <p><strong>As time went by, other gods started to create their own races:</strong><br>
                  &#9679; <strong>Sikander</strong> created the Sikandaris<br>
                  &#9679; <strong>Saleron</strong> created the Prions<br>
                  &#9679; <strong>Dagon</strong> created the Yuantis.<br>
                  &#9679; <strong>Glumo</strong> created the Vampirs and the Gulas.<br> 
                  &#9679; <strong>Yaeryn</strong> created the Jaris.</p>
               <p>However these gods did not completely understand the knowledge within "Arucana Kenaia", as such, "something" is still lacking in their creations when compared to the original six races.<br>
                 The gods, along with the races they created moved to, and starting to populate different areas within Arborea.</p>

                  One day, Mystel went and searched for all the gods, and asked them to congregate at the location where "Arucana Kenaia" was located.</p>
               <p>This is the first gathering of the gods, after Arun and Shara went into slumber. They all shared their knowledge and experience, recording them all onto "Arucana Kenaia", this gathering lasted for 10 years.</p>
               <p>After this gathering, the gods maintained a bond amongst each other, hence the different races got to learn about the existence of other gods as well, thus the beginning of multiple beliefs within the races.</p>

               <p>After Isren's death, in an attempt to protect the Elins and Poporis, Elinu sealed the Sacred Lake within a barrier. Since Elinu is an expert in the art of concealment, no one knew about the Sacred Lake until the the barrier's removal.<br>
                 Because of her foresight, the Poporis and Elins lived together blissfully and joyfully through the Divine Wars.</p>
               <p>However, after sealing the Sacred Lake in a barrier, Elinu removed all her traces and disappeared.</p>

                  Tithus met with "Basade", one of Arn's sons in secret, and used "stopping Sikander's rampage" as a reason to persuade Basade to get him Gidd's Spear. Tithus promised him that it will be returned once the task is completed.</p>

               <p>Not only can Gidd's spear kill a god, it can absorb the essence of said god as well. However, the essence absorbed does not transfer to the wielder of the spear, it is instead being returned back to Arborea.</p>
               <p>However, only Gidd knew about this, leaving Tithus to assume that he has obtained Gidd's essence in the process.<br>
                 Although Tithus was confused as to why he did not feel any stronger than before, he has no way of proving his speculation as he was not clear about what abilities Gidd had to begin with.</p>

                  The Giants soon felt proud that they have exceeded all the other races and in no time, they began conquering the continent in Tithus' name.</p>

                  Amarun was extremely upset that the Giants attacked the Amans without provocation, and rushed to see Tithus.</p>
               <p>A heated discussion soon turned ugly, and in their fight, Tithus killed Amarun in front of the other gods, and pretended to have absorbed his essence. Using this opportunity, he tried to bend the will of the other gods.</p>

               <p>Gods who were close to Amarun such as Saleron, Karas, Zuras, and etc. stood united in the opposing camp. While Thulsa, Akasha, Killian, and Lakan pledged their allegiance to Tithus.<br>
                 Due to earlier defection of Glumo and now Arachne to Tithus' camp, this created an opening for both Saleron and Zuras to be captured. <strong>Although Karas escaped, no one has seen him ever since.</strong></p>

                 The Giants' conquest of the Arun continent was completed, and began their march towards the Shara continent.The Elves knew that it would be impossible to survive without Karas, hence they willingly submitted to the Giants.<br>

               <p>The Elves saw their short-comings compared to the Giants in the field of magic, hence they secretly created a group of bodies dedicated to the study of magic: "Mysterium".</p>

               <p>The Barakas were the wisest and most powerful magic users amongst the Giants, and they continued their studies of "Arucana Kenaia".

               <p>This however, acted as a catalyst in the formation of an opposing force amongst the gods lead by Yurian.

               <p>By using Lok's creation, Yurian caused the sun to went amok, and in one night's time engulfed three major cities of the Holy Empire in a sea of fire. This incident will later be known as "Day of Flame".</p>

               <p>Lok then created structures within the heavenly abode for the gods.<br>

Goddess Elinu was an expert in the art of concealment, and was able to construct and remove any barriers without any effort. <br>
                  However, she only wished to live in peace, and hence her absence in the Divine Wars.</p> 
               <p>When Balder and Elinu released Zuras from his imprisonment, they were surprised by Zuras' response. Zuras figured that as long as the gods don't interfere with the lives of the different races, there would not be a reason for him to resurface.<br>
                   Zuras felt he finally understood why Karas left the Elves; the different races had to learn to be independent and survive on their own.</p>
               <p>Zuras asked Elinu to erase his traces and let him live in peace, Elinu did so, but allowing Zuras the option of escaping from the barrier if he so chose.<br>
                  No one knew about this incident except Balder and Elinu.</p>
               <p>Lakan, who had made himself the patron god of the Devas, worried that Zuras might one day return, but soon abandoned that thought when Zuras failed to emerge.<br>
                  Although Balder wanted to release Saleron from him imprisonment as well, but after he heard of Saleron's threats to Tithus' former allies, Balder discarded the idea.</p>

               <p>Goddess Velik took pity on the nomadic Humans and decided to help them.</p>
               <p>Velik was created from a part of Gidd's essence, therefore there was father-daughter like bond between them. Hence she felt obligated in taking care of Gidd's creation.</p>
               <p>After removing the curse from the Humans, Velik helped them to settle in southern Arun, and forbid them from causing anymore trouble. This led to the creation of "Velika".</p>

               <h4><strong>08- Civil war of the Elves</strong></h4>
               <p>To the Elves, the "Flower of Life" represented eternity. <br>
                  However as time passed, they realised that when they used their magical abilities drawn from the "Flower of Life", life nearby would cease to exists, and the surrounding would be reduced to sand.</p>
               <p>There were elves who suggested a limitation to the usage of "Flower of Life", and to co-exist with the other surrounding life-forms.<br>
                  These elves were known as the "Wind Elves". However, the remainder of the elves cannot resist the temptation of the "Flower of Life" and ignored what the "Wind Elves" suggested and continued with their original ways.</p>
               <p>The "Wind Elves" knew their race would share the Giants' demise if nothing was done. Therefore they attempted to seal away part of the power of the "Flower of Life". However this attempt failed miserably and caused the "Flower of Life" to went amok.</p>
               <p>All the highest elven sorcerers sacrificed themselves in an attempt to settle the "Flower of Life". <strong>Only Serion managed to survive.</strong></p>
               <p>Because of this incident, the tension between the "Wind Elves" and the remainder elven population(they renamed themselves the "High Elves") reached the crescendo, and a civil war broke out. <br>
                  Allemantheia was destroyed in the process, and the "Wind Elves" were wiped out by the "High Elves".</p>    
               <p>The High Elves rebuilt the current Allemantheia where the old one, also the grave site of the Wind Elves, once stood.</p>

               <p>There is a forest that Balder treasured in the Southern Shara continent. Balder would sometimes come here to get a brief rest. One day, Mystel came and visited Balder.</p>
               <p>After a conversation that they had, Balder commissioned the Barakas to build a temple in his garden. After making some arrangements, he entrusted the Barakas with the task of guarding his temple.<br>
                   The leader of the Barakas at that time was Qunso, therefore the Barakas guarding Balder's Temple was also known as the Qunso tribe. Following Balder's directions, Qunso and his tribe migrated to the Southern Shara continent and settled in the forest that Balder liked.</p>
               <p>Some of the Barakas meanwhile moved to Southern Arun and built "Balderon".</p>

               <p>The Barakas are gentle, knowledgeable, and helpful to other races. The Barakas, a stark contrast to their Qunso counterparts whom preferred to keep a low profile, actively shared their knowledge(especially their art in healing) with other races nearby. The High Elves began visiting the Barakas due to this reason.<br>
                  The High Elves highly admired the knowledge possessed by the Barakas, and thus they were the first amongst the other races to be invited to Allemantheia. This slowly began the interaction of different races within Allemantheia.</p>

               <h4><strong>11- Independence of the Amans</strong></h4>
               <p>The enslavement of the Amans did not change, despite the fell of the "Holy Empire".</p>    
               <p>There was a dramatic reduction in Aman population because they were primarily used as a disposable tool by the Giants in their wars. <br>
                  Because they were seen fighting alongside the Giants, they were given the same treatment by other races, as they would to the Giants. This did not change despite the Divine War had ended.</p>
               <p>Luckily, Davan, the hero of the Amans, managed to escape and uncovered the whole truth to everyone. Goddess Kaia took pity on what the Amans had gone through, and decided to help them.</p>
               <p>The Amans have a strong sense of pride. Davan did not wish for Kaia's direct assistance to the Amans, but rather giving them an opportunity to fight the Giants on a leveled playing field. Therefore Kaia went and look for Lok.</p>
               <p>Lok then instructed the Castanics to manufacture items which can help the Amans to break free of their enslavement. <br>
                  These were then given to Kaia, and subsequently, Davan. Davan went to one Giants' encampment after the other(Northern Shara) to free his fellow Amans.</p>
               <p>Davan travelled alone for 23 years, freeing a great majority of the Amans, who stood up and fought the Giants. This time, victory went to the Amans. This also spelt the end for the Giants.</p>
               <p>Amans endured a long and arduous journey as slaves, but they used their own power to break free of that enslavement. Despite being treated as slaves for such a long time, they never forgot who they were. In the eyes of others, they personified a sense of unwavering justice.</p>

               <p>After gaining their freedom from the Giants, the Amans came to Kaia's Temple, where Davan first met Kaia. <br>
                  Northern Shara is a bitter cold place, and not suitable for habitation. Taking pity on their condition, Goddess Kaia then drew the burning flames from deep within the ground, to help the Amans to establish themselves.</p>      
               <p>Using the power of fire, the Amans built their city, and named it "Kaiator", and Kaia vowed to look after the Amans.</p>
               <p>After the Giants had fallen, Kaiator became the heart of Northern Shara. Because of their strength, generosity, and sense of justice, the Amans became the main force in Northern Shara.</p>
               <p>If the High Elves maintained control of Southern Shara with their magical abilities, then the Amans maintained control over Northern Shara because of the pledges of allegiance from others out of their own freewill.</p>

               <p>Because of the destruction brought upon by "Day of Flame", Balder took the "Cerulean Crystal Orb" from the Mysterious Temple(I think this is the one that Arun and Shara built before the went into slumber). The power from the orb restored the damaged continents to their former glory.</p> 
               <p>After the restoration, Balder thought it was time to seal the "Cerulean Crystal Orb" once again, in order to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.</p> 
               <p>Balder looked for Lok, and asked him to build a containment unit for the orb. Because Balder and Lok were close, Lok agreed without hesitation.</p> 
               <p>Thulsa however overheard the existence of this orb and wanted it for himself, therefore he started to plot against Lok.</p> 
               <p>After Lok and the Castanics finished constructing the container, it was delivered to Balder. Thulsa planned to use the container as a means to steal the orb, however the "Cerulean Crystal Orb" went out of control when it came in contact with the unit.</p> 
               <p>The energies from the orb began to destroy the Heavenly Abode. After Balder evacuated the gods from their abode, he commanded Lok to seal the Heavenly Abode along with himself in it permanently, for the safety or Arborea. <br>
                   By doing so, the energies from the "Cerulean Crystal Orb" were finally contained. <br>
                   However, residual energies still managed to split Shara and Arun into two distinct continents.</p>
                    
               <p>However the gods left behind most of their powers in the Heavenly Abode, realizing that they were not that much different from the other races in Arborea, began finding ways to survive on their own.</p>  
               <p>Without the protection from the gods, a new page of challenge had begun...</p>

               <p>Although it was not his fault, but Lok blamed himself for Balder's death. Shakan came to confront Lok about this incident(Balder, Lok, and Shakan were real close).<br>
                  Shakan being the hot-tempered one, attacked Lok. Due to their difference in strength and Lok being occupied by Balder's death, he accidentally killed Shakan. <br>
                  After he realized what he had done, Lok totally lost it and wanted to end his own life, however he was stopped by Mystel. Lok abandoned his weapon and left, never to be seen again. Everyone assumed that he perished in his fight with Shakan.</p>

               <p>Using Lakan's Blood Magic, the Arc Devas turned into a more powerful race, and began to conquer Northern Arun.<br>
                  Aside from the High Elves, all the other races felt the weakening of their patron gods' powers. Using this unrest as an opportunity, the Arc Devas dominated Northern Arun.</p>
               <p>The Arc Devas soon began to move towards Southern Arun. Although the remaining Castanics fought against the Arc Devas, but they were defeated and had to seek refuge in Kaiator, which they had associations with.</p>
