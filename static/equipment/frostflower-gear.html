                      <p>Frostflower gear is the new gear set added in <strong>v114</strong>, as part of new season of TERA named <strong>TERA: FROZEN</strong>.</p>
                      <p>Items are divided into <strong>Legendary</strong> and <strong>Mythical</strong> rarities, differences being in main options and rank of the option.<br>
                         Like previous Mahtnan gear, Frostflower gear has <strong>one unique option</strong>,<strong> two support options</strong> on the top and <strong>3 random options</strong> at the bottom.</p>
                      <p>There is no upgrade to Frostflower gear from Mahtnan gear, but the newly added Transfer system allows players to transfer enchantment level, Random Options, and Etching from one gear to another same like in previous gear.</p>

     <h3>Transfer system</h3>
     <p>Once you reach a certain enchantment level on a piece of gear, you can transfer the enchantment level, Random Options, and etching to another gear of the same part. this requires a <strong>Transcendant Jewel of Magic Transference.</strong><br>
        With <strong>3x Jewels of transference</strong> you can only transfer the random options, without losing your enchantment on the target item.</p>

   <p>Frost flower gear can be crafted. Crafting designs can be purchased from Crafting NPCs in major cities from the Smelting NPC.<br><br>
   You will find two key items - Crafting design <strong>A)</strong> and <strong>B)</strong> and Luxury craft kits.<br>
        You need <strong>20</strong> of the crafting kits to craft one of the tokens. So 80 in total.<br><br>
        <strong>Mythical gear</strong> can be crafted mainly, as its the best source of obtaining this rarity of items. There are two types of tokens:<br>
        <strong>A)</strong> - Frozen Dream Song - You need 7 of these each time to craft which is a total of 28 to make the full set, they drop from dungeons and can obtained dismantling any frost flower gear.<br> 
        <strong>B)</strong> - Frozen Dream Song - Brilliant ice crystal can be obtained by  combining 3 splendid frost flower pollens. Those can be obtained by dismantling mythical gear. Its mainly a way to <i>recycle</i> mythical gear which you wont use.<br><br> 
        Both crafts can 'crit' and give you a special <strong>Splendid Frozen Dream Song</strong> token which can give you items which are Physical(Keen) with only physical options.If your items are eMagical(Mysterious) it will have only magical options. You will never get physical with magical options and vice versa from these tokens.<br><br>      
   </p><br>
   <p>These boxes <strong>CANNOT</strong> be <strong>stored in banks</strong> of any kind, <strong>or traded</strong>.<br>
       However the Items themselves once opened can be sold/banked as you don't bind them.</p>
